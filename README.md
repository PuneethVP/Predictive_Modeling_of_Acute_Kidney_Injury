# Predictive_Modeling_of_Acute_Kidney_Injury
The primary objective is to develop a predictive model using the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset to forecast the onset of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) during an ICU stay.

The dataset is a restricted dataset MIT, and I have used the data with proper permission through the University permission for education purposes.
